#### Introduction
While the the user reference is useful, some parts of spnr need more detailed instructions. For instance, the user reference does not help much with the game engine, as it gives no insight into the general organisation and how to setup a project.

#### Format
Currently, the tutorials are made in markdown - plain text would be too limiting and HTML would be to keep consistent. Each tutorial should be a single markdown document and should provide a link back to the [tutorial hub](#tutorial-hub).

#### Tutorial hub
The tutorial hub (`/tutorials/index.md`) is a file containing links to all of the tutorials and a brief explanation of the tutorials system.
