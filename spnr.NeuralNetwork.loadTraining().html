        <h4>Syntax:</h4>
        <code>spnr.NeuralNetwork.loadTraining(savedTraining)</code>

        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <code>network.loadTraining(savedTraining)</code>

        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>Load the training from a nested array in the form exported by <code>spnr.NeuralNetwork.saveTraining()</code>. The network that is loading the training must have already had its layers created and connected. Fails if the network that saved the training doesn't have the same layer sizes and amounts as the one receiving the training.</p>
